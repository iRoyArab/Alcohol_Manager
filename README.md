This project is an end-to-end data product designed to modernize alcohol inventory management. It bridges the gap between operational logistics and strategic analytics by combining a custom-built Python (Dash) web application for seamless data entry with a cloud-native BigQuery warehouse and an AI-driven decision support system. The system replaces manual tracking with a scalable architecture, enabling real-time stock monitoring, consumption forecasting, and personalized procurement recommendations.
